# AI-Based-Security-Camera

An AI-based security camera is a CCTV camera that uses artificial intelligence algorithms to analyze video footage and identify potential security threats in real-time. These cameras are equipped with advanced features such as object recognition, motion detection, and object detection, which allow them to detect suspicious behavior and alert security personnel immediately.

We detect if any person or human identified in the area then we sent a email notification to the person who owns the area.

AI-based security cameras can also learn and adapt to their surroundings over time, improving their ability to identify and flag potential security risks. Additionally, some models may also be able to automatically track moving objects, zoom in on suspicious activity, and even communicate with other security systems to coordinate a response.

Overall, an AI-based security camera provides an advanced level of security and surveillance, making it an ideal solution for businesses, public spaces, and other high-risk environments.

Live Security system, a simple E-mail based security system that
sends notification on instance of a personal property or private property
invasion by a person. Main objective based on quick response to a
personal or restricted area invasion due to lack in simple day-to-day
live security system in present situation. The focus of the model is to
be a quick and simple E-mail notification system that should be usable
by anyone and maintain ease of use.

  For detection of object (person) we use yolov5 from darknet
which combines bounding box prediction and object classification into
a single end to end differentiable network with the help of an edge
computing device which plays a major role. These two components
enable us in detecting the invaders or unauthorized persons through
CCTV. We store the detected results in a storage device at regular
interval of time and also we backup the video footage in storage
devices.
